    <p>I've worked on several projects while I was in school as well as outside. Check them out below!
    </p>

    <h3><b>GearSim Cloud Management -- SDI Engineering Project</b></h3>

    <table>
      <tr>
        <th>Problem</th>
        <td>SDI Engineering came to us with several trouble areas their company had. After careful planning and discussion
          we concluded their greatest concern was delivering their product to customers. The only way the were selling their products was email or phone inquiry. 
          Once the transaction via phone call took place, they would physically ship out
          an expensive USB dongle to the customer. Product delivery would typically take weeks at a time.
          This often discouraged customers or would make the hand over more difficult than needed.
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th>Solution</th>
        <td>We decided that USB be needed to be removed from the equation. Once a purchase of the product was
          complete, our solution was to use
          online verification via OAuth in connection with Azure Active Directory to authenticate access into the product. This elimnated the use of the expensive USB and physically shipping entirely.
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th>Technologies</th>
        <td>C#, Microsoft Azure (Storage, Active Directory, Application Insights, OAuth 2.0, RESTful APIs, HTML, CSS</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th>Links</th>
        <td><a href="https://www.seattleu.edu/media/college-of-science-and-engineering/files/projectcenter/SU_ProjectsDay2020Booklet_with_links.pdf" target="_blank">Project Day Booklet</a> pg.14</td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <h3><b>REDACTED -- Seattle University Hackathon</b></h3>

    <table>
      <tr>
        <th>Problem</th>
        <td>
          Joined a Hackathon alongside friends. We were given 24 hours to create a project of our choice from scratch.
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th>Solution</th>
        <td>
          After a lot of time spent figuring out what was realistacally in scope in terms of 24 hours we decided on creating an online chat website with a twist.
          The twist being that there would be a command in this chat that any user could use that would permanently redact it. Once a word was redacted, it would always
          show up in the global feed blacked out. We wanted to see how long users could interact and potentially different words that could be created!
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th>Technologies</th>
        <td>JavaScript, NodeJS, socket.io, Firebase, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th>Links</th>
        <td><a href="https://github.com/SAMR1T/REDACTED" target="_blank">REDACTED</a> on GitHub</td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <h3><b>SUFS -- Cloud Based File System</b></h3>

    <table>
      <tr>
        <th>Problem</th>
        <td>
          Given requirements by our professor to create a project that mimics HDFS.
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th>Solution</th>
        <td>
          Prior to coding, created several aritecture diagrams to describe different compenents and features we must create.
          Using AWS, we created on-demand nodes and scaled them with Amazon EC2 instances. Had a web based front end for testing 
        </td>

        <th>Technologies</th>
        <td>Python, AWS (IAM, S3, EC2)</td>
